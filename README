Secret in the Forest

A text adventure written in C by Easter <ethinethin@gmail.com>

================================================================================

This is a text adventure game. Features in the game (all viewable on the help 
screen) include:

	walk		navigate around the world
	look		examine surroundings or item
	search		find hidden items
	take		pick up item
	drop		drop item
	use			use item or items

In the game are 33 rooms, 22 items, and 45 interactions. I recommend playing it
before modifying the code.

================================================================================

I encourage you to fork and modify the game. Below is a key to the files used 
for different functions. 

	main.c             Splash screen, enter input loop
	input.c            Input loop, command parsing, tab completion, endings
	rooms.c            Navigation of rooms
	rooms-desc.h       Room descriptions
	items.c            Take, drop, inventory, and other item functions
	items-desc.h       Item descriptions
	inter.c            Interaction (use) parsing and functions
	inter-even.h       Interaction events 

If you want to write your own game, the main files you should edit are main.c 
(splash screen), input.c (endings), rooms-desc.h, items-desc.h, and 
inter-even.h. The structs are fairly self-explanatory, but I recommend playing 
through the game as is to better understand the events.
